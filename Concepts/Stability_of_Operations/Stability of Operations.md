## Condition Number

The #conditionNumber of a continuous and differentiable function $f$ at the point $c$ is defined as:
$$|\frac {f^\prime (c)}{f(c)}c|$$

## Ill-conditioned and well-conditioned

The process of evaluating a continuously differentiable function $f$ at a point $x = c$ is said to be #wellConditioned if the #conditionNumber is small. Else it is #illConditioned


## Stable and unstable computation

The process of evaluating a function $f$, involving $n$ steps is said to have #instability is at-least one of the steps is #illConditioned . If all steps are #wellConditioned , then the process is #stable
